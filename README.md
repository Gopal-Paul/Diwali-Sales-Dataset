# Diwali Sales Data Analysis using Python

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of a Diwali sales dataset using **Python**. The goal is to analyze customer purchasing behavior during the Diwali festival season and extract meaningful business insights that can help improve sales strategies, customer targeting, and decision-making.

The analysis is performed in **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook** using popular Python data analysis and visualization libraries.
